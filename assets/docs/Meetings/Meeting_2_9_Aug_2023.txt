AGENDA

1. ALPHA Version Development Goals
    - De-identification: Default Anonymize
    - Transfer Incoming: C-STORE SCP
    - Transfer Outgoing: C-STORE SCU
2. ALPHA Demo
    Import & Anonymize:
    - from Horos PACS send:  CR: ["Test" id=999], DX: ["Michael Evans" id=CAN71125...], CT: [Michael Evans" id=12345678901]
    - verify receipt in storage directory
    - check mappings in config.son
    Export:
    - from Anonymizer show received & anonymized studies, send back to Horos PACS
    - verify anonymization by looking at DICOM header
3. BETA UX Preview
3. Questions
    - Necessity for SCP & SCU AET?

    - User settable multi-threaded send/export
    - Floating log window with module and log level filters
